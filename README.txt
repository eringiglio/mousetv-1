This project uses an inexpensive raspberry pi 4. 

Here are some part that will be needed in order to make it work:

-Magnetic door sensor
-Raspberry pi camera CSI connector
-3d printed parts

This code built was created keeping in mind that the Universities Internet security constricted us from uploading files from/to network. In order to adapt to the current restriction this script was developed.

First, power savings mode and the headless feature on a raspberry pi MUST be deactivate/activated 
Second, make sure the right GPIO is selected (no PIN)
Third, this script eventually will have a way to write files into a portable USB flash drive for easy storage and removal.

Currently, the main OS has been cloned and stored for easy access in case the current OS gets corrupted.
